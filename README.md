# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks

This project is aiming to use different Convolutional Neural Network based methods- CNN, VGG16 with pretrained weights, and VGG16 from scratch, to detect digits in given street house images. Digits used for test purpose in this project has different scale, fonts, positions, orientation, light conditions, noise conditions. The model was trained through Tensorflow GPU.
